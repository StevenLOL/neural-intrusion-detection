abstract = {In this paper we illustrate an integrated approach combining Business Intelligence, Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT), which is applied to information resources including structured and unstructured contents, Geo-Spatial and Social Network data, Multimedia (MM), multiple domain vocabularies, classifiers and ontologies. This is implemented in an information system which exploits Associative in-memory technologies in the context of Cloud Computing, as well as Semantic technologies for merging and analyzing information coming from heterogeneous sources. The primary aim is supporting Cultural Heritage Asset crowdsourcing, promotion, publication, management and usage. We describe and discuss, in particular, the application of this system for the analysis of behavior and interest of visitors in different types of populations and visits: on-site/ad-hoc (exhibitions, museums, cultural events) and territorial (historical downtown, archaeological or other touristic areas and routes including cultural resources). In this way it will be possible to provide a common ICT infrastructure and a set of advanced services for all types of subjects interested in the Cultural Heritage domain. The results of the experimentation encourage a Business Intelligence approach which is suitable for both nonprofit, research and business oriented organizations.},

abstract = {The depletion of oil and gas reserves is bringing up economic, political and social issues which encourage the adoption of renewable, green energy sources. Wind energy is a major source of renewable energy because of the maturity and competitive costs of technological solutions to exploit this type of green energy. This kind of power generation is achieved through the use of wind turbines, which convert translational kinetic energy into rotational kinetic energy. The benefits already proven of this type of renewable energy source have motivated nations worldwide to adopt policies to improve the use of wind energy in order to minimize their dependence on oil and natural gas. However, the adoption of wind turbines poses several challenges. A key challenge is properly and timely identifying structural damages which affect the structural health of the wind turbine. In this context, we propose a damage prediction system for wind turbines based on wireless sensor and actuator network. The proposed system, called Delphos, is a decentralized system where all decision-making process is performed within the network, in a collaborative way by the nodes. The purpose of Delphos is to accurately predict when the turbine will reach a damage state, thus allowing timely actions on the turbine operation to prevent accidents, reducing maintenance costs and delays in the power generation. Delphos relies on a time series forecasting model, called ARIMA, and a fuzzy system to eliminate the influence of temperature in the process of damage prediction.},

abstract = {Security is of paramount importance in this new era of on-demand Cloud Computing. Researchers have provided a survey on several intrusion detection techniques for detecting intrusions in the cloud computing environment. Most of them provide a discussion over traditional misuse and anomaly detection techniques. Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) techniques are very helpful in detecting various stealth attacks targeting user-level and kernel-level processes running in virtual machines (VMs) by placing the analyzing component outside the VM generally at hypervisor. Hypervisor Introspection (HVI) techniques ensure the hypervisor security and prevent a compromised hypervisor to launch further attacks on VMs running over it. Introspection techniques introspect the hypervisor by using hardware-assisted virtualization-enabled technologies. The main focus of our paper is to provide an exhaustive literature survey of various Intrusion Detection techniques proposed for cloud environment with an analysis of their attack detection capability. We propose a threat model and attack taxonomy in cloud environment to elucidate the vulnerabilities in cloud. Our taxonomy of IDS techniques represent the state of the art classification and provides a detailed study of techniques with their distinctive features. We have provided a deep insight into Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) and Hypervisor Introspection (HVI) based techniques in the survey. Specific research challenges are identified to give future direction to researchers. We hope that our work will enable researchers to launch and dive deep into intrusion detection approaches in a cloud environment.},

abstract = {Recommender system is a specific type of intelligent systems, which exploits historical user ratings on items and/or auxiliary information to make recommendations on items to the users. It plays a critical role in a wide range of online shopping, e-commercial services and social networking applications. Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most popular approaches used for recommender systems, but it suffers from complete cold start (CCS) problem where no rating record are available and incomplete cold start (ICS) problem where only a small number of rating records are available for some new items or users in the system. In this paper, we propose two recommendation models to solve the CCS and ICS problems for new items, which are based on a framework of tightly coupled CF approach and deep learning neural network. A specific deep neural network SADE is used to extract the content features of the items. The state of the art CF model, timeSVD++, which models and utilizes temporal dynamics of user preferences and item features, is modified to take the content features into prediction of ratings for cold start items. Extensive experiments on a large Netflix rating dataset of movies are performed, which show that our proposed recommendation models largely outperform the baseline models for rating prediction of cold start items. The two proposed recommendation models are also evaluated and compared on ICS items, and a flexible scheme of model retraining and switching is proposed to deal with the transition of items from cold start to non-cold start status. The experiment results on Netflix movie recommendation show the tight coupling of CF approach and deep learning neural network is feasible and very effective for cold start item recommendation. The design is general and can be applied to many other recommender systems for online shopping and social networking applications. The solution of cold start item problem can largely improve user experience and trust of recommender systems, and effectively promote cold start items.},

abstract = {While Cyber-physical system (CPS) is considered as a key foundation for cyber manufacturing, many related frameworks and applications have been provided. This research suggests a new and effective CPS architecture for supporting multi-sites and multi-products manufacturing. As target processes, the manufacturing processes for vehicles' High Intensity Discharge (HID) headlight and cable modules are considered. These modules are manufactured with several multi-manufacturing sites consisting of internal manufacturing tasks and intermediate outsourcing processes. In addition, they produce multiple types of HID cable modules with different components. These issues make it difficult to improve the qualities of the overall processes and to control those considering overall manufacturing plants and processes. In order to overcome these limitations, this research provides an Internet of Things (IoT) embedded cloud control architecture. The mixed flow issues are overcome with the cloud control server with the suggested framework. The developed IoT device detects several system status and transmits the signals. The data is analyzed for the fault detection classification (FDC) mechanism using deep learning based analytics. Then, the cyber manufacturing based simulation is executed using the provided multi-products queueing network model. The estimated simulation results is used for generating dynamic manufacturing decisions reflecting the real-time changes of the production environment. The suggested framework and its implementations can be used for various industrial processes and applications.},

@article{Bosman2017,
abstract = {The field of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), embedded systems with sensing and networking capability, has now matured after a decade-long research effort and technological advances in electronics and networked systems. An important remaining challenge now is to extract meaningful information from the ever-increasing amount of sensor data collected by WSNs. In particular, there is strong interest in algorithms capable of automatic detection of patterns, events or other out-of-the order, anomalous system behavior. Data anomalies may indicate states of the system that require further analysis or prompt actions. Traditionally, anomaly detection techniques are executed in a central processing facility, which requires the collection of all measurement data at a central location, an obvious limitation for WSNs due to the high data communication costs involved. In this paper we explore the extent by which one may depart from this classical centralized paradigm, looking at decentralized anomaly detection based on unsupervised machine learning. Our aim is to detect anomalies at the sensor nodes, as opposed to centrally, to reduce energy and spectrum consumption. We study the information gain coming from aggregate neighborhood data, in comparison to performing simple, in-node anomaly detection. We evaluate the effects of neighborhood size and spatio-temporal correlation on the performance of our new neighborhood-based approach using a range of real-world network deployments and datasets. We find the conditions that make neighborhood data fusion advantageous, identifying also the cases in which this approach does not lead to detectable improvements. Improvements are linked to the diffusive properties of data (spatio-temporal correlations) but also to the type of sensors, anomalies and network topological features. Overall, when a dataset stems from a similar mixture of diffusive processes precision tends to benefit, particularly in terms of recall. Our work paves the way towards understanding how distributed data fusion methods may help managing the complexity of wireless sensor networks, for instance in massive Internet of Things scenarios.},

abstract = {Billions of resources, such as cars, clothes, household appliances and even food are being connected to the Internet forming the Internet of Things (IoT). Subsets of these resources can work together to create new self-regulating IoT applications such as smart health, smart communities and smart homes. However, several challenging issues need to be addressed before this vision of applications based on IoT concepts becomes a reality. Because many IoT applications will be distributed over a large number of interacting devices, centralized control will not be possible and so open problems will need to be solved that relate to building locally operating self-organizing and self-adaptive systems. As an initial step in creating IoT applications with these features, this paper presents a Framework for IoT (FIoT). The approach is based on Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and Machine Learning Techniques, such as neural networks and evolutionary algorithms. To illustrate the use of FIoT, the paper contains two different IoT applications: (i) Quantified Things and (ii) Smart traffic control. We show how flexible points of our framework are instantiated to generate these IoT application.},

abstract = {Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have emerged as a revolutionary technology in many application domains in health-care, fitness, smart cities, and many other compelling Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Most commercially available systems assume that a single device monitors a plethora of user information. In reality, BSN technology is transitioning to multi-device synchronous measurement environments; fusion of the data from multiple, potentially heterogeneous, sensor sources is therefore becoming a fundamental yet non-trivial task that directly impacts application performance. Nevertheless, only recently researchers have started developing technical solutions for effective fusion of BSN data. To the best of our knowledge, the community is currently lacking a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art techniques on multi-sensor fusion in the area of BSN. This survey discusses clear motivations and advantages of multi-sensor data fusion and particularly focuses on physical activity recognition, aiming at providing a systematic categorization and common comparison framework of the literature, by identifying distinctive properties and parameters affecting data fusion design choices at different levels (data, feature, and decision). The survey also covers data fusion in the domains of emotion recognition and general-health and introduce relevant directions and challenges of future research on multi-sensor fusion in the BSN domain.},

abstract = {We propose a multi-style learning (multi-style training+deep learning) procedure that relies on deep denoising autoencoders (DAEs) to extract and organize the most discriminative information in a training database. Traditionally, multi-style training procedures require either collecting or artificially creating data samples (e.g., by noise injection or data combination) and training a deep neural network (DNN) with all of these different conditions. To expand the applicability of deep learning, the present study instead adopts a DAE to augment the original training set. First, a DAE is utilized to synthesize data that captures useful structure in the input distribution. Next, this synthetic data is combined and mixed within the original training set to exploit the powerful capabilities of DNN classifiers to learn the complex decision boundaries in heterogeneous conditions. By assigning a DAE to synthesize additional examples of representative variations, multi-style learning makes the class boundaries less sensitive to corruptions by enforcing the back-end DNN to emphasize on the most relevant patterns. Moreover, this deep learning technique mitigates the cost and time of data collection and is easy to incorporate into the internet of things (IoT). Results showed these data-mixed DNNs provided consistent performance improvements without requiring any preprocessing on the test sets.},

abstract = {Intrusion detection has become essential to network security because of the increasing connectivity between computers. Several intrusion detection systems have been developed to protect networks using different statistical methods and machine learning techniques. This study aims to design a model that deals with real intrusion detection problems in data analysis and classify network data into normal and abnormal behaviors. This study proposes a multi-level hybrid intrusion detection model that uses support vector machine and extreme learning machine to improve the efficiency of detecting known and unknown attacks. A modified K-means algorithm is also proposed to build a high-quality training dataset that contributes significantly to improving the performance of classifiers. The modified K-means is used to build new small training datasets representing the entire original training dataset, significantly reduce the training time of classifiers, and improve the performance of intrusion detection system. The popular KDD Cup 1999 dataset is used to evaluate the proposed model. Compared with other methods based on the same dataset, the proposed model shows high efficiency in attack detection, and its accuracy (95.75{\%}) is the best performance thus far.},

abstract = {Coastal zone is the triple interface of air, water and land and it is so dynamic in nature which requires expeditious management for its protection. Impulsive change in shoreline and submergence of low lying areas due to sea level rise are the solemn issues that need to be addressed. Indian coastline of about 7516 km is under threat due to global warming and related human interventions. Remote sensing data products provide synoptic and repetitive view of the earth in various spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric resolutions. Hence, it can be used in monitoring coastal areas on a temporal scale. Critical Erosion hotspots have to be given proper protection measures to avoid further damages. Satellite images serve in delineating shoreline and extracting the hotspots to plan the mitigation works. Coastal inundation maps can be created using remote sensing and geospatial technologies by assuming different sea level rises. Those maps can serve as a base for planning management activities. Soft computing techniques like Fuzzy Logic, Artificial Neural Network, Genetic Algorithm and Support Vector Machine are upcoming soft computing algorithms that find its application in classification, regression, pattern recognition, etc., across multi-disciplinary sciences. They can be used in classifying remote sensing images which in turn can be used for studying the coastal vulnerability. The present paper reviews the works carried out for coastal study using conventional remote sensing techniques and the pertinency of soft computing techniques for the same.},

The current needs for better control, monitoring and management in many areas, and the ongoing research in this field, have originated the appearance and creation of multiple systems like smart-home, smart-city and smart-grid. However, the limitations of associated devices in the IoT in terms of storage, network and computing, and the requirements of complex analysis, scalability, and data access, require a technology like Cloud Computing to supplement this field. Moreover, the IoT can generate large amounts of varied data and quickly when there are millions of things feeding data to Cloud Computing. The latter is a clear example of Big Data, that Cloud Computing needs to take into account. This paper presents a survey of integration components: Cloud platforms, Cloud infrastructures and IoT Middleware. In addition, some integration proposals and data analytics techniques are surveyed as well as different challenges and open research issues are pointed out.},

abstract = {The network systems of the world are fragile, and can come under attack from any source. The attack can be a denial-of-service (DoS) state or another type of threat. What keep the networks safe are the intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS). They constantly monitor network traffic and if a malicious threat is detected, the threat is blocked and reported for further analysis. However, every defensive system must always have some type of weakness. False negatives and false positives are some examples of how IDPS can fail to protect the network. In another instance, a skilled attacker may employ Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM) to trick the IDPS into detecting no malicious activities. The IDPS is strong, yet not strong enough. This paper presents a hybrid solution that incorporates both signature and anomaly based systems to detect and prevent more malicious attacks by intensifying what is cataloged to include common anomalies to the baselines used by the signature based systems. We also propose an improvement in the framework to current Host IDPS/Network using signature and anomaly based methodologies by implementing a hybrid VMM-based Honeypot into a theorized self-healing hybrid IDPS to further boost their advantages in efficiency and accuracy.},

abstract = {An adaptive intrusion detection system that can detect unknown attacks in real-time network traffic is a major concern. Conventional adaptive intrusion detection systems are computationally expensive in terms of computer resources and time because these systems have to be retrained with known and unknown attacks. In this study, a method called Real-Time Multi-agent System for an Adaptive Intrusion Detection System RTMAS-AIDS, which is based on a multi-agent system, is proposed to allow the intrusion detection system to adapt to unknown attacks in real-time. This method utilizes the classification models multi-level hybrid SVM and ELM to detect normal behavior and known attacks. An adaptive SVM model, in which processes run in parallel and are distributed in MAS, is also used to detect and learn new attacks in real-time. Results show that the proposed method significantly reduced the training cost of detecting unknown attacks compared with the conventional method. In addition, the analysis results of the popular KDDCup'99 dataset show that RTMAS-AIDS can detect Probe, R2L, and U2R attacks better than the non-retrained multi-agent system using the multi-level hybrid SVM and ELM models as well as the multi-level hybrid SVM and ELM. RTMAS-AIDS exhibited a significantly improved detection accuracy that reached 95.86{\%} and can detect and learn unknown attacks faster (up to 61{\%}) than the other two methods (MAS-MLSE and MLSE).},

abstract = {Modernization of our environment (pruning trees for constructing tall buildings) results in climatic changes and ecological imbalance. To mitigate the effect, gardening (to plant trees and shrubs) becomes more and more important than just a hobby. Besides, maintenance of a garden is a tedious process and also time-consuming. Often the gardener lacks in knowledge about the requirements of plant (nutrient and the amount of water to be sprayed) to enhance its growth. In this regard, it is necessary to build an autonomous gardening robotic vehicle which automatically identifies and classifies the plant species using feature extraction algorithms (Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF), Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB)) and neural networks, respectively. It also measures the key parameters for gardening such as temperature, humidity, heat level, wind speed, wind direction and soil moisture. The data acquired from the on-board sensors of the gardening rover are sent to the cloud storage platform on a regular basis. Based on the acquired data and history, future predictions are made to maintain the garden more effectively and efficiently. A website and an android application are developed for monitoring and controlling the rover from a remote area. This system is a combination of new technologies involving an interdisciplinary approach to carry out precision gardening using Internet of Things (IoT).},

abstract = {Anomaly intrusion detection in big data environments calls for lightweight models that are able to achieve real-time performance during detection. Abstracting audit data provides a solution to improve the efficiency of data processing in intrusion detection. Data abstraction refers to abstract or extract the most relevant information from the massive dataset. In this work, we propose three strategies of data abstraction, namely, exemplar extraction, attribute selection and attribute abstraction. We first propose an effective method called exemplar extraction to extract representative subsets from the original massive data prior to building the detection models. Two clustering algorithms, Affinity Propagation (AP) and traditional k-means, are employed to find the exemplars from the audit data. k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used for the detection. We then employ another two strategies, attribute selection and attribute extraction, to abstract audit data for anomaly intrusion detection. Two http streams collected from a real computing environment as well as the KDD'99 benchmark data set are used to validate these three strategies of data abstraction. The comprehensive experimental results show that while all the three strategies improve the detection efficiency, the AP-based exemplar extraction achieves the best performance of data abstraction.},

However, due to the increasingly pervasive existence of smart sensors in WSN, a single localization technique that affects the overall performance is not sufficient for all applications. Thus, there have been many significant advances on localization techniques in WSNs in the past few years. The main goal in this paper is to present the state-of-the-art research results and approaches proposed for localization in WSNs. Specifically, we present the recent advances on localization techniques in WSNs by considering a wide variety of factors and categorizing them in terms of data processing (centralized vs. distributed), transmission range (range free vs. range based), mobility (static vs. mobile), operating environments (indoor vs. outdoor), node density (sparse vs. dense), routing, algorithms, etc. The recent localization techniques in WSNs are also summarized in the form of tables. With this paper, readers can have a more thorough understanding of localization in sensor networks, as well as research trends and future research directions in this area.},

Primitive security techniques like signature-based detection of malware and regular update of signature database are not feasible solutions as they cannot secure such systems, having limited resources, effectively. Furthermore, energy efficient wireless sensor modes running on batteries cannot afford the implementation of cryptography algorithms as such techniques have significant impact on the system power consumption. Therefore, in order to operate wireless embedded devices in a secure manner, the system must be able to detect and prevent any kind of intrusions before the network (i.e. sensor nodes and base station) is destabilized by the attackers. In this paper, we have presented an intrusion detection mechanism by implementing an intelligent security architecture using Random Neural Networks (RNN). To validate the feasibility of the proposed security solution, it is implemented for an existing wireless sensor network system and its functionality is practically demonstrated by successfully detecting the presence of any suspicious sensor node and anomalous activity in the base station with high accuracy and minimal performance overhead.},

abstract = {Internet was developed as a packet data network where users and data sources (server) with specific IP addresses interacted over a pre-established communication channel. This model of client-server data communication has evolved into a peer- to-peer mode of data sharing in recent times. Applications like, YouTube, Bit Torrent, social networks have revolutionized the idea of user generated contents. Modern users care only for specific data items irrespective of their sources. So, the idea of using IP addresses to identify servers hosting a particular content is losing its importance. Moreover, want of IP addresses is a challenging issue haunting the Internet community since long. The need of the time is a content-centric networking platform where data hosts are of less importance, and Named Data Networking (NDN) has been proposed to that end. NDN allows users to float a data request without any knowledge about the hosting entity. NDN can handle user mobility, security issues more efficiently than the current Internet. Although NDN has been proposed in 2010, so far, there is no survey paper studying its architecture and various schemes proposed for its different characteristic features, like, naming, adaptive forwarding and routing, caching, security, mobility, etc. In this paper, we introduce a novel taxonomy to study NDN features in depth. We have also covered several NDN applications. We conclude our survey by identifying a set of open challenges which should be addressed by researchers in due course.},

AIS is a powerful tool in terms of extirpating antigens inspired by the principles and processes of the natural immune system. PBIL uses past experiences to evolve into new species through learning and adopting the idea of CF for classification. The novelty of this research is in its combining of the three above mentioned approaches to develop a new classifier which can be applied to detect network intrusion, with incremental learning capability, by adapting the weight of key features. In addition, four mechanisms: creating a new antibody using PBIL, dynamic adjustment of feature weighting using clonal expansion, antibody hierarchy adjustment using mean affinity, as well as usage rates, are proposed to intensify AIS performance. As shown by the comparison carried out with other artificial intelligence and evolutionary computation approaches in network anomaly detection problems, our PBIL-AISCF classifier can achieve high accuracy for the benchmark problem.},

abstract = {Purpose: Ultrasound scanning has been widely used for preliminary diagnosis as it is non-invasive and has good scope for the doctors to analyze many diseases. Due to lack of trained radiologists in remote areas, tele-radiology is used to diagnose the scanned ultrasound data. Availability of online radiographers and having communication facility for the portable ultrasound are issues in tele-radiology for using ultrasound scanning in remote health-care. In these situations, Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) will be beneficial in diagnosing the patients with minimal manual intervention. Methods: We proposed FPGA based CAD algorithm for abnormality detection of kidney in ultrasound images. The proposed algorithm works in the following way: as a pre-processing, an ultrasound image is denoised and region of interest of kidney in ultrasound image is segmented. Intensity histogram features and Haralick features are extracted from the segmented kidney region. Based on extracted features, the classification algorithm is implemented in two stages. In first stage, a Look Up Table (LUT) based approach is used to differentiate between normal and abnormal kidney images. In second stage, after confirming the abnormality, Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier trained with extracted features is used to further classify the presence of stone or cyst in kidney. The proposed algorithm is implemented on a FPGA based Xilinx Kintex-7 board. Results: The proposed algorithm gave an accuracy of 98.14{\%}, sensitivity of 100{\%} and specificity of 96.82{\%} in detecting the exact abnormality present in kidney ultrasound images. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm and its hardware implementation will be beneficial for diagnosing the kidney in absence of radiologists and internet connectivity.},

abstract = {Constructing a smart home is not a task without intricate challenges due to involvement of various tools and technologies. Therefore, this research work presents a concept of context-aware low power intelligent SmartHome (CLPiSmartHome). For CLPiSmartHome, we propose a communication model, which provides a common medium for communication, i.e., same communication language. Moreover, an architecture is also proposed that welcomes all the electronic devices to communicate with each other using a single platform service. The proposed architecture describes the application, analysis and visualization aspects of the CLPiSmartHome. Furthermore, the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are implemented on Hadoop single node setup on UBUNTU 14.04 LTS coreTMi5 machine with 3.2??GHz processor and 4 GB memory. Sample medical sensory data sets and fire detection datasets are tested on the proposed system. Finally, the results show that the proposed system architecture efficiently processes, analyzes, and integrates different datasets and triggers actions to provide safety measurements for elderly age people, patients, and others.},

abstract = {Billions of devices are now integral part of the day-to-day routine of people but they are sometime incompatible with one another because they employ divergent protocols. The introduction of semantics has been a key enabler towards proper and universal descriptions of connected objects as well as the relationship between them, removing relational ambiguities and improving context-awareness. Virtual objects (VOs) are semantic descriptions of the aggregated native capabilities of physical devices. And as such, they can be readily upgraded over time in order to dynamically suit the processes they are involved with because the context information that is present within them is not necessarily static in time. The original VOs often need to be semantically enriched with more contextual details as they interact with applications and other reasoning engines, where they often evolve into composite virtual objects (cVOs) or rich virtual objects (rVOs) that are more intelligent and interoperable. The complexity of handling large volumes of streaming data increases in the presence of uncertainty caused by incomplete, altered, noisy and/or unstructured information. Context brokering has been a growing trend over the past few years where brokers have been used to discover context and to facilitate processes between service requesting and service providing entities. Several context brokers have been proposed but they do not offer a scalable and optimised brokering algorithm. This necessitates the development of novel ontologies where more functional and non-functional descriptions are used to reduce uncertainties and enrich the content of VOs with the objective of creating a truly automated networking environment.},

abstract = {Due to increase in internet based services, the size of network traffic data has become so large and complex that it is very difficult to process with the traditional data processing tools. Fast and efficient cyber security intrusion detection is a very challenging problem due to big and complex nature of network traffic data. A realistic cyber security intrusion detection system should be able to process large size of network traffic data as fast as possible in order to detect the malicious traffic as early as possible. This paper used Apache Spark, a big data processing tool for processing the large size of network traffic data. In this paper, we have proposed a framework in which first a well-known feature selection algorithm is employed for selecting the most important features and then classification based intrusion detection method is used for fast and efficient detection of intrusion in the massive network traffic. In this work, we have used two well-known feature selection algorithm, namely, correlation based feature selection and Chi-squared feature selection and five well known classification based intrusion detection methods, namely, Logistic regression, Support vector machines, Random forest, Gradient Boosted Decision trees {\&} Naive Bayes. A real time DARPA's KDD'99 data set is used to validate the proposed framework and performance comparison of classification based intrusion detection schemes are evaluated in terms of training time, prediction time, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.},

A shared pool of resources, including data storage space, computer processing power and applications are provided by Cloud computing. In spite of being attractive, it challenges with new security threats when it comes to deploying an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in Cloud environment. It requires a lot of time to process the Cloud dataset and produce proper classification strategy. A Penalty-Reward based instance selection method to reduce the Cloud dataset is proposed here. Using this method all the noisy and boundary instances are removed from the training dataset. After that Reverse Nearest Neighbor Reduction (RNNR) method is applied on the remaining instances to select all relevant instances from them. This helps to reduce the training time as well as to produce better classification accuracy for IDS.},

abstract = {Recent advances in wireless sensor networks have been applied in a variety of applications, including environment, healthcare, and military, based on their distinctive characteristics, such as being small in size and including self-organizing sensor nodes with multi-sensing capabilities and cost-effective monitoring, but there are still a number of constraints that require further exploration. Several of the limitations involve routing and reliability, and one of the key challenges is localization without the aid of global positioning services. On the one hand, GPS tends to be efficiently used only in open areas, and on the other hand, if integrated, the hardware overhead cost could be increased and there could be a smaller the battery lifetime. Thus, with the distance estimation derived from the received signal strength, a range-free localization scheme is promising as a cost-effective approach in which one of the optimization approaches is based on soft computing (which is typically used to address uncertainty and approximation) to achieve practicability and robustness. Thus, this research investigates probable soft computing techniques that are comparatively applied to localizations in a variety of components and subsequently proposes an alternative scheme that utilizes an extreme learning machine to increase the estimation accuracy. To enhance its precision further with a time complexity trade-off, a greedy-based approach that combines modified mass–spring optimizations is integrated and then evaluated by the simulation; these techniques demonstrate effectiveness compared to other state-of-the-art soft-computing-based range-free localization schemes.},

abstract = {Intrusion detection systems are important for detecting and reacting to the presence of unauthorised users of a network or system. They observe the actions of the system and its users and make decisions about the legitimacy of the activity and users. Much work on intrusion detection has focused on analysing the actions triggered by users, determining that atypical or disallowed actions may represent unauthorised use. It is also feasible to observe the users' own behaviour to see if they are acting in their'usual' way, reporting on any sufficiently-aberrant behaviour. Doing this requires a user profile, a feature found more often in marketing and education, but increasingly in security contexts. In this paper, we survey literature on intrusion detection and prevention systems from the viewpoint of exploiting the behaviour of the user in the context of their user profile to confirm or deny the legitimacy of their presence on the system (i.e. review of intrusion detection and prevention systems aimed at user profiling). User behaviour can be measured with both behavioural biometrics, such as keystroke speeds or mouse use, but also psychometrics which measure higher-order cognitive functions such as language and preferences.},

abstract = {Intrusion detection is a promising area of research in the domain of security with the rapid development of internet in everyday life. Many intrusion detection systems (IDS) employ a sole classifier algorithm for classifying network traffic as normal or abnormal. Due to the large amount of data, these sole classifier models fail to achieve a high attack detection rate with reduced false alarm rate. However by applying dimensionality reduction, data can be efficiently reduced to an optimal set of attributes without loss of information and then classified accurately using a multi class modeling technique for identifying the different network attacks. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection model using chi-square feature selection and multi class support vector machine (SVM). A parameter tuning technique is adopted for optimization of Radial Basis Function kernel parameter namely gamma represented by ‘ϒ' and over fitting constant ‘C'. These are the two important parameters required for the SVM model. The main idea behind this model is to construct a multi class SVM which has not been adopted for IDS so far to decrease the training and testing time and increase the individual classification accuracy of the network attacks. The investigational results on NSL-KDD dataset which is an enhanced version of KDDCup 1999 dataset shows that our proposed approach results in a better detection rate and reduced false alarm rate. An experimentation on the computational time required for training and testing is also carried out for usage in time critical applications.},

abstract = {The complexity and scale of critical infrastructures, their strong security requirements and increasing costs require comprehensive methodologies for provisioning cost-effective distributed intrusion detection systems. This paper introduces a novel framework for designing resilient distributed intrusion detection systems. The framework leverages the output of a risk assessment methodology to identify and rank critical communications flows. These flows are integrated in an optimization problem that minimizes the number of deployed detection devices while enforcing a shortest-path routing algorithm to minimize communications delays. The framework engages a resilient distributed intrusion detection design algorithm that accounts for the possibility that detection devices may be compromised or fail. The algorithm optimally positions detection devices to ensure that the infrastructure is resilient to at most K communications path failures. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the distributed intrusion detection design framework.},

abstract = {With the explosion of data generation, getting optimal solutions to data driven problems is increasingly becoming a challenge, if not impossible. It is increasingly being recognised that applications of intelligent bio-inspired algorithms are necessary for addressing highly complex problems to provide working solutions in time, especially with dynamic problem definitions, fluctuations in constraints, incomplete or imperfect information and limited computation capacity. More and more such intelligent algorithms are thus being explored for solving different complex problems. While some studies are exploring the application of these algorithms in a novel context, other studies are incrementally improving the algorithm itself. However, the fast growth in the domain makes researchers unaware of the progresses across different approaches and hence awareness across algorithms is increasingly reducing, due to which the literature on bio-inspired computing is skewed towards few algorithms only (like neural networks, genetic algorithms, particle swarm and ant colony optimization). To address this concern, we identify the popularly used algorithms within the domain of bio-inspired algorithms and discuss their principles, developments and scope of application. Specifically, we have discussed the neural networks, genetic algorithm, particle swarm, ant colony optimization, artificial bee colony, bacterial foraging, cuckoo search, firefly, leaping frog, bat algorithm, flower pollination and artificial plant optimization algorithm. Further objectives which could be addressed by these twelve algorithms have also be identified and discussed. This review would pave the path for future studies to choose algorithms based on fitment. We have also identified other bio-inspired algorithms, where there are a lot of scope in theory development and applications, due to the absence of significant literature.},

abstract = {The progressive application of Information and Communication Technologies to industrial processes has increased the amount of data gathered by manufacturing companies during last decades. Nowadays some standardized management systems, such as ISO 50.001 and ISO 14.001, exploit these data in order to minimize the environmental impact of manufacturing processes. At the same time, microgrid architectures are progressively being developed, proving to be suitable for supplying energy to continuous and intensive consumptions, such as manufacturing processes. In the merge of these two tendencies, industrial microgrid development could be considered a step forward towards more sustainable manufacturing processes if planning engineers are capable to design a power supply system, not only focused on historical demand data, but also on manufacturing and environmental data. The challenge is to develop a more sustainable and proactive microgrid which allows identifying, designing and developing energy efficiency strategies at supply, management and energy use levels. In this context, the expansion of Internet of things and Knowledge Discovery in Databases techniques will drive changes in current microgrid planning processes. In this paper, technical literature is reviewed and this innovative approach to microgrid planning is introduced.},

abstract = {Abstract It is the premise of accessing and controlling cloud environment to establish the mutual trust relationship between users and clouds. How to identify the credible degree of the user identity and behavior becomes the core problem? This paper proposes a user abnormal behavior analysis method based on neural network clustering to resolve the problems of over-fitting and flooding the feature information, which exists in the process of traditional clustering analysis and calculating similarity. Firstly, singular value decomposition (SVD) is applied to reduce dimension and de-noise for massive data, where map-reduce parallel processing is used to accelerate the computation speed, and neural network model is used for softening points. Secondly, information entropy is added to hidden layer of neural network model to calculate the weight of each attribute. Finally, weight factor is used to calculate the similarity to make the cluster more accuracy. For the problem of analyzing the mobile cloud user behaviors, the experimental results show that the scheme has higher detection speed (DS) and clustering accuracy than traditional schemes. The proposed method is more suitable for the mobile cloud environment. },

abstract = {Face recognition has been one of the popular and important parts in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) systems that find tremendous applications, some of which are very critical like access control, surveillance, etc. There are numerous techniques available to process face images and hence, choosing an optimal algorithmic chain is not a straight forward job. The scenario gets much more interesting while implementing face recognition in applications connected to cloud via Internet of Things (IoT) platform. This paper reviews some of the effective face recognition algorithms and proposes an optimized algorithmic chain offering optimal classification accuracy and lower execution time; thereby making it appropriate for IoT related applications targeting human-centric systems. Also, achieving optimum efficiency by selecting appropriate number of features for a given combination of algorithms and the behaviour of algorithms due to partitioning of the images in case of Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is discussed. Results indicate enhanced classification rates with algorithmic fusion by creating chains or process flow of methods. Accuracy of up to 96{\%} was obtained for one of the chains that were designed. Also, it is evident from the results that this chain outperforms some of the well-known state-of-the-art methods.},

In recent years, computer networks are widely deployed for critical and complex systems, which make them more vulnerable to network attacks. In this paper, we propose a two-stage Semi-supervised Statistical approach for Anomaly Detection (SSAD). The first stage of SSAD aims to build a probabilistic model of normal instances and measures any deviation that exceeds an established threshold. This threshold is deduced from a regularized discriminant function of Maximum Likelihood (ML). The purpose of the second stage is to reduce False Alarm Rate (FAR) through an iterative process that reclassifies anomaly cluster, from the first stage, using a similarity distance and anomaly's cluster dispersion rate. We evaluate the proposed approach on the well-known intrusion detection dataset NSL-KDD and Kyoto 2006+. The experimental results show that SSAD outperforms the Na??ve Bayes methods in terms of Detection Rate and False Positive Rate.},

Cloud computing as a solution has been deployed to satisfy vehicles in VANETs which are expected to require resources (such as computing, storage and networking).

abstract = {Due to the distributed nature of Denial-of-Service attacks, it is tremendously challenging to identify such malicious behavior using traditional intrusion detection systems in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In the current paper, a bio-inspired method is introduced, namely the cooperative-based fuzzy artificial immune system (Co-FAIS). It is a modular-based defense strategy derived from the danger theory of the human immune system. The agents synchronize and work with one another to calculate the abnormality of sensor behavior in terms of context antigen value (CAV) or attackers and update the fuzzy activation threshold for security response. In such a multi-node circumstance, the sniffer module adapts to the sink node to audit data by analyzing the packet components and sending the log file to the next layer. The fuzzy misuse detector module (FMDM) integrates with a danger detector module to identify the sources of danger signals. The infected sources are transmitted to the fuzzy Q-learning vaccination modules (FQVM) in order for particular, required action to enhance system abilities. The Cooperative Decision Making Modules (Co-DMM) incorporates danger detector module with the fuzzy Q-learning vaccination module to produce optimum defense strategies. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) was simulated using a network simulator. The model was subsequently compared against other existing soft computing methods, such as fuzzy logic controller (FLC), artificial immune system (AIS), and fuzzy Q-learning (FQL), in terms of detection accuracy, counter-defense, network lifetime and energy consumption, to demonstrate its efficiency and viability. The proposed method improves detection accuracy and successful defense rate performance against attacks compared to conventional empirical methods. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms are two techniques for optimization and learning, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The two have generally evolved along separate paths. In this paper we have described a different genetic algorithm which can be used to train the feed forward neural network which is used to identify the Intrusions effectively. We have been succeeded in the process of identifying the intrusions effectively with the proposed GA Weight extraction algorithm. We have classified the connections as normal and abnormal using the obtained weights and computed the accuracy of the proposed model.},

@article{Wang2010,
abstract = {Many researches have argued that Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) can improve the performance of intrusion detection systems (IDS) when compared with traditional methods. However for ANN-based IDS, detection precision, especially for low-frequent attacks, and detection stability are still needed to be enhanced. In this paper, we propose a new approach, called FC-ANN, based on ANN and fuzzy clustering, to solve the problem and help IDS achieve higher detection rate, less false positive rate and stronger stability. The general procedure of FC-ANN is as follows: firstly fuzzy clustering technique is used to generate different training subsets. Subsequently, based on different training subsets, different ANN models are trained to formulate different base models. Finally, a meta-learner, fuzzy aggregation module, is employed to aggregate these results. Experimental results on the KDD CUP 1999 dataset show that our proposed new approach, FC-ANN, outperforms BPNN and other well-known methods such as decision tree, the na{\"{i}}ve Bayes in terms of detection precision and detection stability.},
